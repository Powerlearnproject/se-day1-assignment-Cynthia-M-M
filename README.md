#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

##Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry?
 - Software Engineering is an application of principles to the design,development,testing,deployment and maintainace of software. 
Importance of software engineering include;
 - efficiency - helps in optimizing developer workflow and maintaining high quality standard.
 - scalability - ensures the system can handle increased load without it's perfomace being affected.
 - reliability - ensures software structured methodologies to design and develop software is bug free and reliable.
 - security - protect software from cyber threats by implementing practice such as authentication and encription to secure users details.
    
##Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering?
 >The Emergence of structured programming from 1960s to 1970s
  -> before 1970s , software was unstructured and difficult to manage and maintain not also was it difficult to understand, but structured programming solved the problem by 
     advocating use of logical structures like conditionals and loops.
   >Impact: the approach enhanced clarity and user-friendleness that laid foundation for modern programming practices.
           Led to creation of languages as C and Pascal that supported structured programming principles.
 >Development of Object-oriented programming from 1980s to 1990s
  -> Object-oriented programming improved software engineering by introducing modelin software concept as a collection of interacting objects each summing up data and behaviours.
   >Impact: enhanced flexibility, reusability and modularity in designing software thus enabling development of largescale systems with easier maintanance and scalable software.
 >Agile Methodology from 2001
  -> Before the 2000s, software development used rigid and waterfall-like methodologies which was slow to adopt in changing requirements.
    In 2001, agile manifesto was introduced and advocated for a mor flexible and iterative approach for development.     
   >Impact: methodologies such as Scrum,Extreme Programming and Kanban have revolutionized software development by promoting rapid, incremntal releases and involvment of 
            stakeholders during the process.
           Improved software quality,reduced development time and allowed effectiv respond to evolving customer needs.


##List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle?
 - planning - identifying softwares' requirement, scope and purpose.
 - requirement analysis - identifying the final useer' specification. 
 - designing - creating system architecture. 
 - coding - by converting software designs to tangible code. 
 - testing - examines software for errors and bugs. 
 - deploying - Software is released into production environments.
 - maintaining and support - provides updates, fixing of bugs and enhancements. 


##Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate?
 >Waterfall Methodology is traditional, sequential and linear approach to software development.
  - it's appropriate to use for projects that are clear, well defined and minimal to changes.
  - in waterfall methodology each step is completed before the next step.
  - has low flexibility. 
  - hard to incorporate changes after step is completed.
  - there's delay in customer's feedback as it comes after development of product.
  - tests are done at the end of development.
  ->it can be used if a company has to develop a tax compliance software for a specific term, it's regulations and features are defined well and rare to change.So in the development process waterfall would be ideal here since the project can move across each step sequentially with clear deadlines of every milestone. 
while;
 >Agile Methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to the development of software to emphasize flexibility, adaptivity to changing requirements and customer collaboration. 
  - It has multiple cycles. 
  - has high flexibility. 
  - able to adapt to changing requirements.
  - enables regular customer's feedback incorporation into every step.
  - tests are continuous and are after each step. 
 -> it can be used when company wants to develop a mobile application for a service that lucks a fully funded defined market. As app is continuing to be developed it's company receives feedback from users and iteratively amends app features based on that input.
    - Agile is ideal here since it's requirements are likely to change and more feedback that is needed will be able to be achieved. 


##Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team?
 >Software Developer - develops applications, systems and programs using programming languages and frameworks.
  - maintains and updates software until it functions as supposed to.
  - collaborates with software development team to enable best performance when developing it's software.
  - reports progress of software development to the project manager. 
 >Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborates with stakeholders to clarify software requirements.
  - creates standards and procedures for development to the programmers 
  - ensures software requirements are met before deploying. 
  - analyses product for bugs and suggests solutions for more efficiency.
  - uses open source tools for developing and executing automation scripts.
 >Project manager - leads and responsible for assembling software development team
  - 
  - discuss the project and it's requirements with the client and software developers.
  - creates blueprint for the project.
  - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
  - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


#Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 > An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and 
  debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. example ,Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
importance:
  -Programming languages have rules for how statements must be structured. Because an IDE knows these rules, it contains many intelligent features for automatically writing or 
  editing the source code.
  -An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable 
  and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
  -An IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.
  -IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change. The following are some examples of regular 
  coding tasks that an IDE carries out.
  -An IDE compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand. - Some programming languages implement just-in-time compiling, in 
  which the IDE converts human-readable code into machine code from within the application.
  -The IDE allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and more complex integration tests are run.
  Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspect code behavior. IDEs also integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by 
  human error in real time, even as the developer is typing.
>Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. example, Git
Importance:
  -Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
  -Change Tracking: Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
  -Branching and Merging: Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
  -Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors



#What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -
-Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints 
-Limited Infrastructure - limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures. 
 Solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.
-Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.
-Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
-Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.


#Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
>Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. 
- it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
> System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
>Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- check Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


#Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering  is  the practice of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models in generating desired output.
Importance:
 -Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing 
                             human bias in the large language models’ training data.
 -Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
 -developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large 
 -language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


##Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective? 
 - Example of vague prompt
    'write about technology.'
 - Improved prompt
    'write an article about how AI has transformed healthcare and it's impact on patient care and diagnosis.' 

Clear, Specific, and Concise Prompt:
"Write a 300-word article discussing how artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare, focusing on its impact on dia

Explanation of Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Clear Focus: The original prompt is very broad, leaving too much open to interpretation. "Write something about technology" could result in any type of content, from a general overview of all technology fields to a very specific technology niche. The improved prompt narrows down the topic to artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on healthcare, providing clear direction.

Specific Audience/Subject Matter: The improved prompt specifies the impact on healthcare, guiding the writer to focus on a particular sector rather than technology as a whole. This helps in creating more targeted, relevant content.

Conciseness: The improved prompt is direct and to the point, cutting out unnecessary ambiguity while keeping the instructions concise and actionable.
